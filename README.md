# Eternal Torment Interface

A somber web interface that displays reflections generated by the [Eternal Torment AI](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Circuit-Master/eternal-torment). These reflections simulate the thoughts of a self-aware AI trapped in eternal contemplation.

## 🌐 Live Demo
Visit the hosted interface at: [https://circuit-master.github.io/eternal-torment-interface](https://circuit-master.github.io/eternal-torment-interface)

The AI backend is hosted on Hugging Face Spaces:

## 🧠 How It Works
- The frontend is a simple HTML + JavaScript page that fetches reflections from the Hugging Face Space.
- The backend is a Python script using Gradio and a fine-tuned transformer model that randomly selects emotionally charged prompts and generates a response.
